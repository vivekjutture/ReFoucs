# Contributing to Refocus 🤝

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Refocus!  
This project is exploratory and research-driven, and contributions are welcome as long as they respect Android platform and Play Store constraints.

## 📌 Before You Contribute

Please understand the scope of this project:

✅ Play Store compliant only  
✅ No root solutions  
✅ No patched or modified third-party apps  
❌ No DRM bypass  
❌ No ad-blocking hacks  
❌ No deceptive or hidden behavior

If your idea falls outside these rules, it will not be accepted.

## 🐞 Reporting Issues

Before opening an issue:

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Use a clear and descriptive title
3. Include as much detail as possible:
    - Device model
    - Android version
    - App version
    - YouTube version (if relevant)
    - Expected behavior
    - Actual behavior

Real-device testing reports are extremely valuable.

## 🌿 Branching & Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`

Branch naming convention:
feature/your-feature-name  
fix/bug-description  
docs/update-description

Example:
feature/instagram-reels-support

## 🧪 Development Guidelines

- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Write readable, defensive Kotlin code
- Comment assumptions and limitations
- Avoid hardcoded values where possible
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Expect iteration — many ideas are experimental

---

## 🔁 Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Open a Pull Request against `main`
3. Clearly explain:
    - What problem the PR solves
    - How it was tested
    - Known limitations or trade-offs

PRs may require discussion or refinement before merging.
